                                Table tennis made its Olympic debut at the 1988 Seoul Games, bringing greater global exposure and establishing it as a serious, elite-level sport.

                                The ITTF changed the ball size from 38mm to 40mm to slow down gameplay slightly and make matches more exciting and easier to follow for audiences, especially on TV.
