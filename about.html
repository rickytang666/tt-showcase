                            <p>
                                Table tennis originated in Victorian England as a parlour game played by the upper class.

                            <p>
                               The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was founded in Berlin, and the first World Table Tennis Championships took place in London, officially organizing the sport on a global level.

                                A surprise friendship between Chinese and American players during the 1971 World Championships in Nagoya, Japan helped thaw Cold War tensions and led to the historic visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon to China.

                            <p>
                                Table tennis made its Olympic debut at the 1988 Seoul Games, bringing greater global exposure and establishing it as a serious, elite-level sport.

                                The ITTF changed the ball size from 38mm to 40mm to slow down gameplay slightly and make matches more exciting and easier to follow for audiences, especially on TV.
